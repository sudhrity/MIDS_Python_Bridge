- Shawn : First guinea pig for the new breakouts repository. Owned it and attacked it right away!
- Maya : Helping out with automation for homework share - thinking about this correctly. Care to demo?
- Scott and Aaron : Super helpul comments on the wall clarifying Q3 for HW4. Used it in office hours to explain others as well!

# New Repos

You should have gotten a notification on the platform about these but it's worth rehashing.

- [Breakouts](https://github.com/MIDS-INFO-W18/breakouts)
- [homework-share](https://github.com/MIDS-INFO-W18/homework-share)

The power is all in your hands for how to organize things. I've provided the naming conventions to set a bit of a watermark but feel free to keep commenting and playing around with github to get to know it better.

# Giving Good Feedback

Now that we're starting to give and receive feedback, let's go over really quickly how to give good feedback. "Good" isn't a subjective thing. We need to be wary of being too critical because remember, we're all learning. Always be respectful!

# Exams

- 1 Hour in betwween the 17th and 22nd of this month.
- Not going to be really hard, hopefully a combo of theory as well as practical code.
- Should be in line with the breakout sessions that we're doing.
- No notes, no open book, no internet help

This is a watermark that will allow you to know if you're on track or not at this point in time.

# Helpful Resource: PyMOTW
Now that we're getting to modules it's cool to get introduced to things that you wouldn't normally see and problems that you haven't come across yet. I would recommend that you subscribe to [PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/index.html) by Doug Hellman.

> PyMOTW-3 is a series of articles written by Doug Hellmann to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python 3 standard library. 

# Homework Discussion

- You should be submitting 1 `.ipynb` file within the week. If your folder layout does not look like what we have in the assignment-upstream repository you've got something that you need to fix.
- What constitutes appropriate use of external sources? Don't go crazy getting everything off of stackoverflow because guess what, when the exam comes stackoverflow won't be there.
  - The point of homework isn't to "import library" use function, it's to do it all from scratch to learn how to do it from scratch. Keep that in mind.

*Note: Please update your week-2 homework folder with your week 2 homework, week-1 would also be helpful.*

- Releasing as jupyter notebook? If we do this you might get auto-merging which would be annoying for you all, also if you edit the notebook, that means that you're going to have to handle merge conflicts if we update the assignment and stuff like that. It's not necessarily as straightforward as you might hope.

# Breakout Session

This is a time where you will be working on a problem set in the given repository. You will be working with a partner or set of partners on the problem. If you were the one coding last week, please try NOT to be this week in order to give everyone a chance in the driver seat. You'll need to clone the below repository in order to be able to participate.
