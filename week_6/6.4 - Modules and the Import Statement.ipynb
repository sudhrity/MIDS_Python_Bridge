Large programming teams need to be organized, with different people in charge of different files.  Even if you are working on your own, you may want to divide your code into separate files in an intelligent way, so different functionality goes in different places.\n",

When you do this, you are bringing code that somebody else wrote into your own program.  Now we will see how to modularize your own code so that you can use it in other scripts or so other programmers can use it."
